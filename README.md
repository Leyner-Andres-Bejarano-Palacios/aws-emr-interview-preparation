# aws-emr-interview-preparation
this as well as the other repos in the series "interview_preparation" are meant to work as study guide for getting better at been software and data engineer. In this one I will introduce the ambiguios section, because I am aware that more than one answer would fit.

I am also aware that emr are just a bunch of servers and the real important thing to understan is python, sql, spark, hadoop, hive, s3 and aws concepts like ec2 and security groups. I already have python, sql and spark repos (that I will continue nurturing) and I will soon have repos of the series "interview preparation for the rest".
